# that, since this implementation uses only standard Python 3 objects, you can try to include this
# in scripts and run them using Pypy 3, Cython 3 or any other Python 3 implementation.

#   [ sum(                                     # Summation
#       [
#         xn                                   #   of every sample

#       ])
#       for k, _ in enumerate(x) ]             # Repeat for every coefficient;
#
# Here is the analysis equation (in LaTeX form) for comparison:
#
#  X[k] = \sum_{0}^{N-1} x[n] e^{-j 2 \pi k n / N} \; k = 0 \ldots N-1
#
# This implementation is not, of course, very efficient, since it doesn't take advantage of the
# regularity of the twiddle factors, and computes complex exponentials for every term.
