% To run, enter the command line interpreter and compile the module:
%
% $ erl
%
% 1> c(fft).
% 2> fft:start().
%
% Or you can compile the program to Erlang bytecode and interpret it, using the following commands:
%
% $ erlc fft.erl
% $ erl -noshell -s fft start -s init stop

%     Power of two of the size of the vector on which the transform will be applied;
%   Repeats

% Discrete Fourier Transform directly from the definition, an algorithm that has O(N^2) complexity.
% This implementation uses list functions to compute.
%
% This version is a tail-recursive implementation. It has the same parameters and behaviour of the
% non-tail recursive version, but is probably more time and memory efficient.
%
% Parameters:
%   x
%     The vector of which the DFT will be computed. Given the nature of the implementation, there is
%     no restriction on the size of the vector, although it will almost always be called with a
%     power of two size to give a fair comparison;
%
% Returns:
%   A complex-number vector of the same size, with the coefficients of the DFT.
